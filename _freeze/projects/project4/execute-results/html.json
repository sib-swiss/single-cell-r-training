Cervical cancer progression involves complex interactions between immune cells and tumor cells, leading to an immunosuppressive microenvironment. To investigate these interactions, this study utilizes scRNA-seq data from normal cervix, high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (HSIL), and cervical cancer tissues to analyze transcriptional responses in immune cells.\n\nUnsupervised clustering of transcriptional profiles revealed distinct immune cell populations and their interactions with tumor cells. Differences in immune cell states were linked to the progression of cervical cancer and the establishment of an immunosuppressive microenvironment. Specifically, the study identified unique HPV-related epithelial clusters and critical node genes that regulate disease progression. The transition from normal cervix to HSIL and cervical cancer was marked by changes in immune cell populations, including T cells, dendritic cells, and macrophages.\n\nFurther analysis identified key immune cell subsets and their roles in shaping the tumor microenvironment. Network analyses demonstrated that immune cell interactions influence functional T cell programs and systemic immune coordination. This study provides insights into how immune remodeling impacts cervical cancer progression and highlights transcriptional markers that could be used to predict patient outcomes and guide therapeutic strategies.\n\n## Available data\n\nThese samples represent different stages and conditions of cervical tissues, providing a comprehensive dataset for analyzing the progression from normal cervix to cervical cancer.\n\n1.

For example, if clustering is not according to cell types, try to adjust the number of components or the resolution. \n",
