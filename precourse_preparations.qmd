## Required competences

Participants should already have a basic knowledge in Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) techniques, or have already followed the course [NGS - Quality control, Alignment, Visualisation](https://sib-swiss.github.io/NGS-introduction-training/2021.11/). Knowledge in RNA sequencing is a plus. A basic knowledge of the R statistical software is required. Test your R skills with the quiz [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdIyeuabd_ZOWXgI1MWHapmaOMu20L9ESkLDZiWnpmkpujyOg/viewform?usp=sf_link), before registering.

## Software

Attendees should have a Wi-Fi enabled computer. An **online R and RStudio environment** will be provided. In order to access that environment your computer needs to be able to access http websites (not https). You can check this by browsing to [http://www.httpforever.com](http://www.httpforever.com). However, in case you wish to perform the practical exercises on your own computer, please take a moment to install the following before the course:

- [R](https://cran.r-project.org/) version > 4.0. 
- Latest RStudio version, the [free version](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/) is perfectly fine.
- The R packages necessary for the course. Find the script to install them [here](https://github.com/sib-swiss/single-cell-training/blob/master/Docker/install_packages.R).
